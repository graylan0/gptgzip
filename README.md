This Python script uses the OpenAI API and the gzip module to compress a text string and send it to the GPT-3.5-turbo model for processing. The text is first compressed using gzip, then converted to a string format that can be sent to the model. The model is informed via a system message that the user input is a GZIP encoded datapackage. The model's response is then printed out.
